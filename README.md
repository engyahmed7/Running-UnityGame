# Running UnityGame

Welcome to Running UnityGame, a game that's inspired by the popular game Temple Run. In this game, you play as a character who is running away from the police, trying to collect money while avoiding obstacles and hazards. The police are constantly chasing you, and as time passes, they become faster and more difficult to avoid. Your goal is to collect as much money as possible and avoid getting caught by the police or hitting obstacles. If you collide with an obstacle or the police catch you, the game is over, and you have to restart.

## Getting Started

To play Running UnityGame, you will need to download or clone the repository from GitHub using the following link:

https://github.com/engyahmed7/Running-UnityGame

Once you have downloaded the repository, you can open the project in Unity and run the game from the editor. Alternatively, you can build the game and run it on your computer.

## How to Play

To control your character, use the arrow keys on your keyboard. Use the left and right arrow keys to move your character left and right, respectively. Use the up arrow key to jump over obstacles and hazards.

Your goal is to collect as much money as possible while avoiding obstacles and hazards. Money is scattered throughout the game, and you can collect it by running over it. The police are constantly chasing you, and as time passes, they become faster and more difficult to avoid. If the police catch you, the game is over, and you have to restart.

There are also two power-ups that you can collect to help you on your run. The first power-up will make the police stop for 2 seconds, giving you a chance to get away. The second power-up will make obstacles disappear for a short time, making it easier to avoid them.

## Game Difficulty

As time passes, the game becomes more difficult. The police become faster and more difficult to avoid, and obstacles become more frequent and harder to avoid. Keep an eye out for power-ups, as they can help you survive longer.
